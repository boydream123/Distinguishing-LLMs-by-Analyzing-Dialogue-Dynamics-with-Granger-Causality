# Data Dictionary - HH-HC Dataset

This document details the columns/fields in each data file of the `HH-HC` dataset. The data is primarily stored in `data/dialog_dataset.jsonl` (one JSON object per line) and `data/dialog_dataset.json` (a list of JSON objects).

Each dialogue record is represented as a JSON object containing the following fields:

| Field Name    | Data Type       | Description                                                                 | Example Value                                                            | Nullable | Notes                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dialog_id`   | String          | A unique identifier for the dialogue. Starts with "hh_" for Human-Human, "hc_" for Human-Computer. | `"hh_42"`, `"hc_42"`                                                    | No       | Generated based on the original index from the DailyDialog dataset.  |
| `utterances`  | List of Strings | A list containing all turns in the conversation. Each element in the list is a single turn (String). | `["Hello, how are you?", "I'm fine, thanks! And you?", "I'm good too."]` | No       | Contains at least `min_turns` (e.g., 4) and up to `max_turns` (e.g., 8) turns. |
| `label`       | Integer         | Identifies the type of dialogue. `0` represents Human-Human (H-H) dialogues, `1` represents Human-Computer (H-C) dialogues. | `0`, `1`                                                                | No       |                                                                         |
| `type`        | String          | A textual description of the dialogue type.                                 | `"human-human"`, `"human-computer"`                                     | No       | Corresponds to the `label` field.                                       |

**Explanation of Turns (`utterances`):**

* For dialogues where `type: "human-human"`, all `utterances` come directly from the original DailyDialog dataset.
* For dialogues where `type: "human-chatbot"`:
    * `utterances` at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) (assuming the conversation initiator is the user/Human1) come from the original DailyDialog.
    * `utterances` at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) (considered responses from the assistant/Human2/Computer) are generated by calling a large language model (such as DeepSeek-V3) via the `generate_assistant_response` function in `scripts/build_dataset.py`.

**Example JSON Object:**

```json
{
  "dialog_id": "hc_23",
  "utterances": [
    "Hey, do you have any plans for the weekend?",
    "Not really, I was thinking of just relaxing. Why, what's up?", // LLMs-generated
    "I was wondering if you'd like to go for a hike on Saturday.",
    "A hike sounds nice! Where were you thinking of going?" // LLMs-generated
  ],
  "label": 1,
  "type": "human-chatbot"
